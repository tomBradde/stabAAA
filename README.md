# stabAAA
Public code for the stabAAA algorithm, introduced in

"A modified AAA algorithm for learning stable reduced-order models from data"

available at:

"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16978"

The repository is still WIP.

The source Files are included in the Source folder. Running them will require availability of MATLAb, Yalmip Optimization toolbox and Solver Mosek (or equivalent). Last two items are available online (Mosek with Academic licensing requirement).

Additional folders contain scripts to run the stabAAA algorithm on the experiments described in the related article.
